/**
 * This class provides methods for the robust handling of I/O using Scanner.
 * It creates a new Scanner object for each read from the user, thereby eliminating the Scanner bug
 * (where the buffers don't flush correctly after an int read).
 *
 * The methods also parse the numeric data entered to ensure it is correct. If it isn't correct,
 * the user is prompted to enter it again.
